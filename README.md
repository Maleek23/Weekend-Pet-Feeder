## 4. Code Overview

### 4.1 Main

The main routine handles:

- **Hardware initialization**
- **UART, PWM, EEPROM, and peripheral setup**
- **Parsing user commands from the UART RX buffer**
- **Calling appropriate handlers for each command**
The main while loop polls the UART, ready to receive and parse user commands.

### 4.2 User Command Handling

Key user-facing functionality is exposed through UART commands. Custom handlers process and execute each command.

**Example Feed Scheduling Command Flow:**

1. User enters event details over UART
2. Input fields are parsed and validated
3. Extracted feed data gets written to the next available EEPROM slot
4. UART message confirms the written schedule
Similar flows handle time setting, water level alerts, reviewing schedules, etc. Invalid commands print error messages.

### 4.3 Sensing & Dispensing

MCU peripherals like ADC, PWM, Timers, and GPIO allow interfacing with attached hardware to enact system functions:

- ADC comparator triggers on capacitive sensor to measure water level
- PWM signals control motors for precise dispensing
- Timers enable timed events and sensor sampling

## 5. Detailed Code Analysis

### 5.1 initHw()

The initHw() function initializes various hardware components, including GPIO, analog comparator, PWM, and others. It ensures the proper configuration of the microcontroller peripherals required for the pet feeder system.

### 5.2 initUart0()

The initUart0() routine configures the UART0 peripheral for serial communication. It sets registers such as UART clock, baud rate, and data length, facilitating communication with external devices or a user interface.

### 5.3 initHm()

The initHm() function initializes the Hibernation Module, utilizing the real-time clock (RTC) in calendar mode for scheduling events and timer interrupts. This module enables efficient power management for scheduled tasks.

### 5.4 initEeprom()

The initEeprom() function initializes the EEPROM controller, ensuring reliable read/write operations for non-volatile storage of schedule data. It is a crucial part of the system for persistently storing user-defined feeding schedules.

### 5.5 parseFields()

The parseFields() function plays a key role in handling user input. It parses raw ASCII user input into discrete data fields for further processing. It identifies alphanumeric and numeric fields, allowing the system to extract command arguments accurately.

### 5.6 isCommand()

The isCommand() function checks if the parsed input corresponds to an expected command. It validates that the required minimum arguments are provided before executing the command.

### 5.7 PWM Initialization (initpwm())

The `initpwm()` function initializes the PWM module, configuring GPIO pins and PWM parameters. This enables precise control over the motors used for dispensing food and water. By setting appropriate PWM values, the system achieves accurate and adjustable dispensing of predetermined amounts of food and water.

### 5.8 Main Function (main())

The main function orchestrates the overall functionality of the system. It includes:

- **Hardware initialization:** Calls functions to set up various hardware components, ensuring they are ready for operation.
- **UART, PWM, EEPROM, and peripheral setup:** Configures communication interfaces, PWM for motor control, and initializes EEPROM for persistent data storage.
- **Parsing user commands from the UART RX buffer:** Monitors the UART for incoming user commands, parsing and validating them for further execution.
- **Calling appropriate handlers for each command:** Routes parsed commands to specific handlers, enabling the execution of corresponding functionalities.

The main loop continuously checks for user commands, making the system responsive to user inputs and ensuring the proper functioning of the pet feeder.

### 5.9 RTC Initialization and Interrupts

The `initHm()` function initializes the Hibernation Module, utilizing the real-time clock (RTC) in calendar mode. This setup facilitates scheduling events and timer interrupts, crucial for managing power efficiently. The RTC ensures precise timing for scheduled tasks, contributing to the system's reliability.

### 5.10 Hibernation Module Initialization

The Hibernation Module initialization involves configuring the RTC for calendar mode. This allows the system to enter low-power states during idle periods, conserving energy. By utilizing the RTC and implementing hibernation, the pet feeder can operate autonomously while consuming minimal power.

### 5.11 EEPROM Functions

The `initEeprom()` function ensures the proper initialization of the EEPROM controller. This is essential for reliable read and write operations, enabling the storage and retrieval of user-defined feeding schedules. Persistent data storage in EEPROM ensures that programmed schedules are retained even during power cycles.

### 5.12 System Initialization

The system initialization involves setting up various hardware components, communication interfaces, and peripherals. It ensures that the embedded system is in a known state before executing user commands. Proper system initialization contributes to the stability and functionality of the pet feeder.

### 5.13 Fill Mode, Alert, and Schedule Commands

These functions handle specific user commands:

- **Fill Mode:** Initiates the filling of the water dish when activated by the user. Utilizes PWM-controlled motors for precise water dispensing.
